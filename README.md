# marvel-movie-database

### In this project, I want to explore in following task:

Webscrapping from wikipedia pages to create a database for marvel movies with Beautifulsoup. 
(source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films)

Cleaning data, pattern matching with regular expressions etc.

Saveing data as JSON file for later analysis.

Converting data to a SQL database and run query from python.

Some SQL query exploration:

Longest marvel movie so far?

Which three movies have highest profit? (Box office - Budget)

How much is the total Box office sale of The Iron Man series?
